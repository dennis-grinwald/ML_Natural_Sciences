Applying ML on real life applications in the natural sciences
Following up, a brief summary of the notebooks and the problems they tackle:

## 1. Bioinformatics:
DNA-sequence classification, using  the weighted degree kernel methods and a Support Vector machine.
## 2. Brain Computer Interfacing:
Classification brain-potential measures into physical movements.
Classifier used:
- Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA)
## 3. Hyperspectral Remote Sensing:
Comparison of different methods for landmark pixel classification. The methods that were compared are:
- Gaussian Mixture-based classifier
- Spectral clutering-based classifier
- Convolutional Neural Network
